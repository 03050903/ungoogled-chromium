# Packaging metadata
# 
# Format:
# Section names are directories containing packaging files.
# Each section has two optional keys:
# * depends - List of dependencies. During generation, files in dependencies are overwritten by dependents.
# * buildkit_copy - Path relative to packaging to copy buildkit to. If omitted, buildkit is not copied.
# Also, keys from dependencies are inherited by dependents.
